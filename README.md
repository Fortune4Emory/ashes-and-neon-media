# Ashes & Neon Media — v2 Test Commit 

This is a hand-built, no-templates starter for your studio/publisher site.
Host it **free** on Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. The only annual cost is your **domain**.

## 🔧 Quick Deploy (Cloudflare Pages — $0 hosting)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push these files.
2. In Cloudflare → **Pages**, connect your repo and pick `main` as the branch.
3. Build config: **Static site** (no build command needed).
4. After deploy, set your custom domain (e.g., `ashesandneonmedia.com`) in Cloudflare.
5. SSL, CDN, and cache are automatic.

## 🌐 Domain (one-time yearly)
- Buy at Cloudflare Registrar (at-cost) or Namecheap.
- Set DNS to Cloudflare (if your domain isn’t already there).

## ✉️ Custom Email (free forwarding)
- Use **Cloudflare Email Routing** to forward `hello@` → your Gmail.
- For sending mail, set up a Gmail alias (or use a low-cost SMTP like Mailgun/SendGrid later).

## 🧩 Local Dev
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.

## 📁 Structure
- `index.html` — homepage
- `styles.css` — theme
- `script.js` — tiny JS
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple placeholder logo
- `assets/hero-loop.mp4` — optional loop (replace with your clip or remove the <video>)

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Replace logo and video.
- Add pages: `/books.html`, `/films.html`, `/press.html` or keep it single-page.
- Wire up a contact form (Formspree/Netlify forms or a tiny serverless function).
